Not to mention, he also starred opposite Jessica Chastain in the Oscar-winning biopic The Eyes of Tammy Faye.Since working on these though, Garfield has decided to take some time for himself.

In the play, the actor portrayed Prior Walter, an openly gay New Yorker who contracts AIDS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Garfield’s performance led to his first-ever Tony Award. At the same time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he also caught the attention of Lin-Manuel Miranda </a>who was preparing to make his directorial debut with tick, tick... BOOM! at that time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Andrew Garfield After His 'Spider-Man' Trilogy?</a></span></p><p>“I was smitten with him in that production. I locked in on him as Jonathan Larson and the idea never went away,” Miranda recalled. The director even agreed to moderate a panel for Angels just so he would have the opportunity to pitch his Netflix film to Garfield. Miranda’s plan worked.</p><p>“We got sushi at Katsuya on 50th Street, and it was the first time I’d ever sat down with him. He didn’t know anything about Jonathan Larson, and I gave him the whole spiel, and he seemed intrigued,” he said of Garfield.</p><p>And when Miranda asked the actor if he could sing, Garfield only asked how long before they’d start filming in response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Andrew just looked at me and goes, ‘In that case, I can sing,’” the director recalled.</p><h2 id=he-lost-his-mom-just-before-starring-in-tick-tick-hellip-boom>He Lost His Mom Just Before Starring In tick tick…BOOM!</h2><p>Garfield’s mother, Lynn, was diagnosed with cancer just before he agreed to do The Eyes of Tammy Faye. And while he wanted to stay home, his mother insisted on taking on the project.</p><p>“She said, ‘I would struggle with you not doing it on account of me,’” Garfield recalled. “I told her, ‘OK, but promise me when it’s time to come home you’ll let me know.’”</p><p>Garfield would make it back home in time to be by his mother’s side before her passing in late 2019. “We had all the quality time we could possibly have while she was here,” the actor said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And those last two weeks I got to be with her were probably the most profound two weeks of my life.

Existence. The shortness of this window we have. I think that’s working on me in profound ways that I’m probably not even aware of.”</p><p>At the same time, Garfield is also pleased with how well his recent projects turned out. “We’re never satisfied, really, but there was – I don’t know – a semblance of satisfaction that I started to feel, with how Tick, Tick… Boom! turned out, with how Angels in America turned out,” he continued. “And actually with how being involved in that Spider-Man movie turned out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Garfield’s ready, he’ll determine what’s next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBurc2dqZ6vXZyus7LInqOdZaSWuKq6xmaYZpqimq6secWrpqZlkZjBqrrGaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./antawn-jamison-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Antawn Jamison Net Worth</a>

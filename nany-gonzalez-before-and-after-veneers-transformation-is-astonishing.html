Nany had the procedure done in Turkey.</p><p>She went to UK Smile in Antalya, Turkey, to get her <a href=# rel=noopener>teeth fixed</a>. It was <a href=# rel=noopener>made public</a> in January 2020 when the clinic put up a video for everyone to see.</p><p>UK Smiles offers a wide range of cosmetic dentistry services and has been taking care of teeth for more than 20 years. In the past few years, it has become popular with people from the UK who like to travel for high-quality treatments.</p><p>In the video, the reality star praised the service at the clinic and said that other people who want to protect their smiles should also go there. “Everyone is friendly and makes you feel at home,” she said.</p><p>She said that she was scared to go to Turkey and wanted to keep her smile hidden. Gonzalez went on, “We’ve already done that.” She also said that she was lucky to have the chance and was very happy with the service.</p><p>On their Facebook page, the dental clinic also posted a “before” and “after” <a href=# rel=noopener>picture of the reality star</a>. In the picture of Gonzalez’s teeth after the change, they were straighter and whiter than before.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth Salary Details Of Filipino Actress Cherie Gil</strong></p><h2 id=why-did-gonzalez-get-veneers>Why Did Gonzalez Get Veneers?</h2><p>UK Smiles gave Nany veneers because her teeth were a <a href=# rel=noopener>little bit</a> uneven and pale. She didn’t want to lose her smile.</p><p>Veneers are thin shells of porcelain or resin that are put on the front of teeth to make them look better.</p><p>They can be used to fix problems like gaps, chips, teeth that aren’t the right shape, and stains.</p><p>Since Gonzalez is a <a href=# rel=noopener>public figure</a>, it’s likely that she wanted to improve her smile, so she got veneers.</p><p>People feel more confident and attractive when they have a better smile. This can make you more <a href=# rel=noopener>interesting and draw more people</a> to you.</p><p>Gonzalez now smiles brightly and shows off her white teeth. She must have felt a lot different after getting her teeth fixed.</p><p>Even though a lot of <a href=# rel=noopener>people liked her new look, there were also a lot of people who liked her old</a> look.</p><p>But because people are different, they see things in different ways. You can’t make everyone happy, and it’s nearly impossible to do so. With this in mind, we should always be ourselves. Gonzalez has done just that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nany-Gonzalez-1-300x242.png><h2 id=fans-react-to-gonzalez-reveal>Fans React To Gonzalez’s Reveal</h2><p>In 2019, a <a href=# rel=noopener>Reddit user</a> thought that Nany got veneers at the reunion, which made people take notice of her teeth.</p><p>The user wrote, “I love Nany. At the reunion, I saw that she got veneers.” “I <a href=# rel=noopener>think they’re</a> too big and white. Her natural teeth were beautiful,” they said.</p><p>Another person said, “I <a href=# rel=noopener>don’t know</a> why she got CHOMPERS for her new teeth.”</p><p>The other Reddit group talked about how Gonzale’s veneer fell off while everyone was standing around her at the reunion. “I can’t think of anything more embarrassing,” said one person.</p><p>Some of her <a href=# rel=noopener>fans have said nice things about her new look on social media</a>, but others seem upset about the change. <a href=# rel=noopener>People say that her veneers make her mouth look too big</a>.</p><p>The star of The Challenge hasn’t <a href=# rel=noopener>said anything</a> about these comments, and she seems happy with how she looks now. She shows off her bright smile with confidence and seems more upbeat.</p><p>Well, if we keep talking, the reality star is pretty even without veneers.

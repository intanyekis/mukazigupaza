While she was joined by her children, Lourdes, 26, David Banda, 17, Mercy James, 17, and 10-year-old twins Stella and Estere, it was her oldest son Rocco, 23, that the attention revolved around momentarily, as he was introduced to Madonna's boyfriend, Joshua Popper, for the first time.</p><p>While there were no reports about how the meeting went between the two, according to The Sun, the family celebrated the night away together.

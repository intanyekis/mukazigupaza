According to Bravo TV, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wants Radke to find his passion</a> and become successful on his own instead of choosing the easiest option.</p><p>"This is what Carl does.

Let's check out some of the most noteworthy moments.</p><p>Radke's work ethic has been a point of contention between the two as Hubbard stated she finds hard-working men attractive and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">does not think Radke is "crushing life,"</a></strong> according to Bravo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carl-and-lindsay-smiling-for-photots-at-an-event.jpg><p>Shortly after the episode aired of Hubbard dissing Radke's work ethic, she shared more about the new man in her life in an episode of The Bitch Bible and how different their relationship is compared to her and Radke's. <strong>Her words were a clear diss to Radke</strong> considering it's a stark contrast to everything she said about Radke's work ethic and traits.</p><p>“He’s successful in his own field and has a great job. He works very hard, is extremely driven and ambitious and, yeah, and keeps me happy in the bedroom.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kyle-Cooke-And-Amanda-Batula.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="This Is Why Newlyweds Kyle Cooke And Amanda Batula Don't Watch 'Summer House' Together">This Is Why Newlyweds Kyle Cooke And Amanda Batula Don't Watch 'Summer House' Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kyle Cooke and Amanda Batula have been through a rollercoaster ride of a relationship on Bravo's 'Summer House'.</p><p><strong>Hubbard has stayed mum on who her new boyfriend is</strong> but said on The Bitch Bible that he's a former flame who is not in the reality TV world.

The two were close friends but didn't test their romance until Season 4. However, that relationship was short-lived and they went back to being friends. Fast forward to 2021, feelings between the two friends were stirred up once again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lindsay-hubbard-smiling-for-photos-at-the-cmas.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her stint on <a href=#>Bravo's Winter House where she dropped major news</a> about a heartbreaking miscarriage, she saw the light through the tunnel with Radke and started dating for the second time. Hubbard told People <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how happy she was in their relationship</a>.</p><p>"I don't think I've ever been in a healthier relationship. Falling in love with your best friend, I don't think there's any better feeling in the world."</p><p>The two got back together after connecting at <a href=#>Kyle Cooke and Amanda Batuala's wedding</a>. A year later, Radke and Hubbard made things official with an on-screen proposal. Fans saw how happy the two were before going back to the house and telling their Summer House castmates.

With a wedding set in stone for November 2023, <strong>the two called it quits two months prior.</strong> Carl Radke released a statement to People explaining their separation.</p><p>"We are so incredibly sorry to all of our guests for the confusion and lack of communication. We were left trying to figure out how this all exactly happened before we could even have the opportunity to determine the path forward amongst ourselves."</p><p>Shortly after Radke's statement, Hubbard shared her own on Instagram. "My entire life and future was ripped out from underneath me and I’ve had a hard time making sense of it all - with no answers or closure on why." She later said she was "humiliated" by the way the breakup happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Audiences soon found out that their breakup was filmed,</strong> that they would see all the highs and lows of their relationship unfold on TV, and why the wedding didn't happen. Despite their hardships, Hubbard expressed that Radke "blew up" her life and she was "blindsided."</p><p>Although they canceled the wedding, Hubbard and her friends continued with her bachelorette party to celebrate friendship, as noted by People. Likewise, all the small details were already set in stone for their Mexican destination wedding. Page Six shared that guests already had flights and hotel rooms booked. Instead of letting it all go to waste, many Bravolebrities kept their travel plans and vacationed in Mexico. Summer House cast members Kyle Cooke and Gabby Prescod documented the Mexican weekend with Radke's parents. Likewise, Vanderpump Rules stars Sheana Shay and Brock Davies were seen partying with Cooke and Prescod.</p><p>Now that the breakup between Carl Radke and Lindsay Hubbard is final, and Hubbard is newly dating, fans of Summer House are wondering what Radke will do now that he's single and back to working at Loverboy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqWdmr9utM6uqp5lnJ67pb%2FAsmShrZKXrrOwjJ2grKuVqHqmxIycmKukXaeupbfEZqWer12XvLqy0aKcp5xf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./top-10-greatest-beards-in-sports.html>&#171;&nbsp;Top 10 Greatest Beards In Sports</a>

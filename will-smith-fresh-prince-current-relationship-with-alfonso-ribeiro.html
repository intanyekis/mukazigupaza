the '90s. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair's friendship</a> also blossomed before fans' eyes on and off the set of <strong>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</strong>. Despite their seemingly different personalities on the show, Will and Alfonso were no doubt the best and funniest duo on TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the end of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will has gone on to have an impressive career</a> and had starred in some of Hollywood's biggest films over the years. Though now very busy with work and their family, fans wonder if Will and Alfonso have maintained their bond. Here is all to know about the duo's long-time friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Friends Will Smith Keeps Just To Keep Ahead</a></span></p><h2 id=smith-and-ribeiro-before-the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Smith And Ribeiro Before The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air</span></h2><p>Back in 1990, before the launch of the memorable sitcom, Will was an up-and-coming rapper who performed with his friend and DJ, DJ Jazzy Jeff. Will's professional name was Fresh Prince. This would later morph into the Hollywood sphere when he met film and TV producer Quincy Jones. At the time, Jones convinced him to jump on the project, and Will was at first skeptical. This was because he had never been on a TV show. Ribeiro, on the other hand, had just completed a three-year stint on Silver Spoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=then-came-fresh-prince-of-bel-air><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Then Came Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air</span></h2><p>And so it became that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will&nbsp;Smith</a>&nbsp;, an inexperienced actor, met Ribeiro, who already knew his onions. However, this did not matter because they quickly grew fond of each other. On the show, Will and Ribeiro, were cousins who lived together, meaning they were around each other a lot. This onscreen brotherly chemistry morphed into a real sweet friendship.</p><p>Once speaking about how he and Will became TV colleagues, Ribeiro relayed that at the beginning, he had to make a choice between The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and A Different World. However, after hanging out with Will and Jeff, the actor shared that he felt that there was "some sort of magic there." He added that he thought Will and Jeff were special people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=smith-and-ribeiro-have-remained-close-knit><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Smith And Ribeiro Have Remained Close-Knit.</span></h2><p>The famous sitcom ended in 1996, but the actors' friendship only became stronger. Will confirmed this in a 2020 post honoring Ribeiro's 49th birthday. The star reveled in the joy of having a long friendship with his castmate. He shared heartwarming words noting that he had known Ribeiro through "30 birthdays." Ribeiro, who Will called "ride or die," also confirmed that their "bromance" has been blissful through the years. He described the "Aladdin" actor as a "wonderful individual" he has known for over 25 years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith's $250 Million Mistake</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-pull-surprises-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Pull Surprises Together</span></h2><p>While the pair advanced in age and career, they have never forgotten their inner child. The delightful duo made this known in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">surprise appearance on The Graham Norton Show</a>. It all started as a father-son rap session between Will and his son, Jaden Smith. However, Will decided to tweak it, and fans could not get enough. He introduced Ribeiro to the stage, and they all did the famous dance "The Carlton."</p><h2 id=they-share-a-few-similar-interests><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Share A Few Similar Interests</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With how long their friendship has lasted, it comes as no surprise that Will and Alfonso have a few shared interests. These days the Men in Black actor and Dancing With The Stars star have reclined a little to share their love for golf. They play the game together and also flaunt their skills on social media.</p><h2 id=they-support-each-other><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Support Each Other</span></h2><p>TV dad James Avery who played <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Banks passed away in 2013</a> due to health complications. Expectedly, Ribeiro and Smith were there for each other with each paying tribute in the best way they deemed fit.</p><p>Back in 1995, Will faced heavy media backlash after his marriage failed with Sheree Zampino. All these happened while he was still a regular on Fresh Prince. The actor had a hard time fending off the backlash as he was reportedly regressing and turning into "an empty shell." Fortunately, Ribeiro was there by Smith's side, making sure he came out stronger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Fans Are Worried About Will Smith's Career</a></span></p><h2 id=ribeiro-once-defended-will><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ribeiro Once Defended Will</span></h2><p>When asked a few years ago if Will ever cast him in his movies, Ribeiro replied saying no but added that it was not enough to create animosity between them. He defended his pal, noting that it was not Will's responsibility to give him movie roles. Ribeiro shared that he felt like being in other movies alongside Will could come across as a Fresh Prince remake. The Catch 21 star added that Will's role on their 90's sitcom was well delivered, and that was what he owed every cast member. The movie star relayed in essence that all cast members were responsible for themselves after the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-families-witness-the-warmth-of-their-friendship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Their Families Witness The Warmth Of Their Friendship</span></h2><p>The "America's Funniest Home Videos" star once relayed how much closeness he and Smith add up to having families together. He has also commended Smith's son for going in his father's footsteps. Smith once shared on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" that Ribeiro taught his oldest son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trey&nbsp;Smith</a>, to drive. He jokingly said that Trey's driving lessons had been accurate enough that he could perfectly rev.</p><h2 id=the-love-extends-to-other-cast-members><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Love Extends To Other Cast Members</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smith and Ribeiro's closeness extends to their other cast members. Through the years, everyone, including Ribeiro's TV sister Tatyana Ali has remained close. Back in 2017, the <a href=#>cast members met up for a bittersweet reunion.</a> They were all glad to see each other, but they felt the absence of the patriarch, Avery.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Will Smith's Siblings, And Is He Close To Them?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoqScYsCutdOhZJ%2Bqlai1brzRoqWcnV2YwrO%2BxKerZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLEqsDHZpilnp%2BjwLB50aKZnqGipHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./angie-k.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Angie K RHOSLC, Husband Rumors, Net Worth, Birthday, Net Worth, Husband, House, Parents, Inst</a>

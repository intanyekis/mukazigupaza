Now more than ever before, companies are looking to occupy offices with superior ventilation, natural light, access to nature and amenities. CBRE Limited represented Menkes and TD Asset Management (TDAM) as the listing agent for the building, and Devencore represented Richardson GMP in the transaction. The building is currently 65% leased.</p><p>"We're thrilled that Richardson GMP shares our vision for our newest office development, which will support the transition of returning to physical office space by promoting a healthy work environment," said <span class=xn-person>Peter Menkes</span>, President, Commercial/Industrial. "This new lease may signify the recovery of the <span class=xn-location>Toronto</span> office market as it is the first significant office lease in downtown <span class=xn-location>Toronto</span> following the global health pandemic. This deal brings the building to nearly two thirds leased as we continue with the final year of construction until we open its doors. We look forward to welcoming Richardson GMP to their new home."</p><p>"Richardson GMP is excited to move forward with our long-term plan to develop our firm into the powerhouse wealth-planning provider of the future, and our planned new headquarters is a core part of this strategy," said <span class=xn-person>Andrew Marsh</span>, Chief Executive Officer, <span class=xn-person>Richardson GMP</span>.</p><p>"We believe our offices at 100 Queens Quay East will more aptly reflect our forward-facing outlook, prestigious brand and industry stature as a leading independent wealth management firm for our existing and, importantly, next-generation Advisors and Clients. This new space creating a hybrid approach to the future of work will support collaboration, connection, communication and idea exchange. By opting for a more modern building infrastructure, we will also be better able to take full advantage of the inevitable changes in workplace dynamics stemming from the pandemic."</p><p>The office tower features approximately 690,000 square feet of Class "AAA" space. Designed by B+H Architects, the tower has been conceived with the objective of achieving the highest standards in environmental sustainability by striving for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED") Platinum certification, which is an internationally-accepted rating system that recognizes excellence in the design, construction and operation of green buildings. LCBO will be occupying approximately 225,000 square feet, with the ground floor featuring a 25,000 square foot flagship LCBO retail store.</p><p>"The addition of Richardson GMP to the building represents a significant vote of confidence in the <span class=xn-location>Toronto</span> office market and is another endorsement of our high-quality building.&nbsp;Our excitement continues to build as another key tenant has committed to the energy and growth story in and around 100 Queens Quay East," said <span class=xn-person>Jeff Tripp</span>, Managing Director, Real Estate Investments, TDAM.</p><p>100 Queens Quay East is the first phase of Sugar Wharf, Menkes' vibrant new mixed-use community, which includes office, retail, residential, <span class=xn-location>Toronto's</span> first vertically integrated school, and a two-acre public park. It will be the largest mixed-use development on the <span class=xn-location>Toronto</span> waterfront, and home to 7,500 residents and approximately 4,000 office workers.</p><p>Richardson Wealth, as it will be known then, is expected to move into its new space in 2023.</p><p><b>About Menkes Developments Ltd</b><br>Menkes Developments Ltd. is an award-winning, fully integrated real estate company involved in the construction, ownership and management of office, industrial, retail and residential properties.

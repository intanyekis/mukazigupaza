Up to this writing, millions of videos have been using the song's 20-second audio, and it doesn't seem to be dying any minute soon. So, what is it to know about the singer, and what are her next moves after a "career resurgence" on the video-sharing app? Here's a look at Alice Merton's life and her rise to TikTok fame.</p><h2 id=alice-merton-39-s-early-life><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Alice Merton's Early Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The crooner hails from Frankfurt, Germany, where she was born in September 1993 in a mixed family of a German mother and an Irish-born father. Growing up, young Alice moved out quite a lot. She had lived in Connecticut before moving to Ontario, Canada until the age of thirteen. Her family returned to Munich shortly after to finish her high school education. She relocated to London, England, after graduating.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Living in different places has influenced my music in various ways</a>. When I was growing up in Canada I was listening to a lot of classical music, even opera. I don’t know why but I was obsessed with opera. I think a lot of the melodies are still swimming around in my head which is one of the reasons I love good melodies," she recalled in an interview with Lemonade Magazine.</p><h2 id=alice-merton-39-s-39-no-roots-39-was-released-over-6-years-ago><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alice Merton's 'No Roots' Was Released Over 6 Years Ago</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Contrary to popular belief where only new and hotly-released songs get boosted on TikTok, Alice's "No Roots" is a track from six years ago. Released on December 2nd, 2016, "No Roots" is Alice's debut single under her old-time imprint Paper Records International. Her experience of the nomadic past has shaped the song to be where it is today. She croons, "I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down / Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running / 'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Gayle?

Titled No Mint, the project features singles like "No Roots" and "Lash Out," which were previously featured on her debut EP. The album incorporates elements of dance-pop with touches of jazz here and there, and she re-released it in late 2019 with four additional tracks.</p><p>"I was trying to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> find this one thing that summed up all the experiences I’ve been through</a> in the last three years. I couldn’t find it. I was thinking for like four months and suddenly I just kind of woke up one morning, and no joke I just knew it was supposed to be called MINT!," she recalled the creative process in a 2019 interview with Atwood Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alice-merton-coached-on-the-german-edition-of-39-the-voice-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Alice Merton Coached On The German Edition Of 'The Voice'</span></h2><p>In addition to singing, Alice Merton also secured a coaching seat on the ninth season of Germany's The Voice.

"‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No Roots’ is like the stem, and the other songs branch out</a>."</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-alice-merton><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next For Alice Merton?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what's next for Alice Merton?

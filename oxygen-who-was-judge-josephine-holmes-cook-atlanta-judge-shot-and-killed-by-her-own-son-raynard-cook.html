The story begins when on October 16, 1996, a 911 call, was made from the suburban neighborhood.</p><p>The call was made by the neighbor, according to Clint Rucker, former executive District Attorney, Fulton County, Georgia, told “The Real Murders of Atlanta,” who says, “The neighbor next door reported that a young man, Raynard Cook, had come home from school and discovered his mother’s body in a pool of blood in the house.”</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Who Was Judge Josephine Holmes Cook?">Who Was Judge Josephine Holmes Cook?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="What Happened To Josephine Holmes Cook?

After receiving the 911 call, the authorities found her lying in a pool of blood downstairs of her home on October 16, 1996.</p><p>According to the Oxygens, Judge Josephine was the woman of dedication, faith, and ambition. She, at the time, suffered a loss in her bid for re-election, and with that information, her death was viewed as suicide.</p><p>However, upon further investigation, the case was confirmed to be a homicide after it revealed that she was shot at the back of her right shoulder. Authorities later discovered a9.mm empty brass casing.</p><p>At the home, blood was all over the place, which indicates, “She tried to drag herself downstairs to make a call from the downstairs phone and she bled to death,” said Rhonda Cook, a former journalist.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-josephine-holmes-cook-atlanta-judge-shot-and-killed-by-her-own-son-raynard-cook></span>What Happened To Josephine Holmes Cook?

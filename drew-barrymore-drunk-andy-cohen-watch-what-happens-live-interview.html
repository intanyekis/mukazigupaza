Between drinking too much on New Year's Eve and leaving everyone guessing when <a href=#>he claimed to be in love with John Mayer</a>, Cohen knows how to get people's attention.</p><p>Of course, one of the keys to Cohen's success has been getting stars like <strong><a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a></strong><a href=#>who are rich</a> and famous to be more open with the public than usual. Sadly for Barrymore, however, she can't forgive herself for how she acted when Cohen interviewed her, even though he thinks she is overreacting.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore-had-too-much-to-drink-on-watch-what-happens-live>Drew Barrymore Had Too Much To Drink On Watch What Happens Live</h2><p>Now that Drew Barrymore is a talk show host herself, she must be learning how important it is to get guests to open up. After all, while Barrymore has had guests complain about her interviewing style, like Brooke Shields, many stars seem to love talking to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/drew-barrymore-1.jpg><p>In March 2018, Barrymore made an appearance on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live with her Santa Clarita Diet co-star Timothy Olyphant. In the aftermath of that interview, some of the things Barrymore said garnered attention, but that is almost always the case for Cohen's show.</p><p>If it wasn't for the fact that Barrymore later drew attention to her interview, her appearance almost certainly would have been mostly forgotten. However, when Cohen and Barrymore spoke again two years later, she put a huge spotlight on how she acted on Watch What Happens Live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Cohen appeared on Barrymore's behind-the-scenes series, Art of the Interview, in August 2020, the two TV hosts spoke about their previous interaction. During their conversation about Barrymore's Watch What Happens Live appearance, she explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why she will never forgive herself for how she acted</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-22t085827-249.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Drew Barrymore's Clinginess Made Brooke Shields Uncomfortable While "Denying" Her Mom "Exploiting" Her</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Drew Barrymore and Brooke Shields' emotional interview was overshadowed by the host's touchy interview style.</span><p>“It was on your show, and I drank too much and I have never forgiven myself, nor will I ever forgive myself. Because, whatever personal thing I do, nobody sees it even though I’m an imperfect person, and I tout that, and I’ve had that liberty since I was a kid because it was all out there. And it was either boo hoo about it or say, ‘God, it’s sort of redeeming to not have to pretend to be perfect.’ But I really want to apologize to you because I really — I just, I will never let that happen again.

On a second viewing, it becomes pretty clear that Barrymore does seem like she may have had a few too many.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A perfect example of that is a clip of Barrymore talking about one of the most infamous moments of her career. During a 1995 appearance on his talk show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barrymore infamously flashed Letterman</a> while standing on his desk.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What were the most memorable moments on David Letterman's talk shows</a>, according to Time?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bill Murray is Dave’s first guest</strong></li><li><strong>Andy Kaufman challenges wrestler Jerry Lawler to a match</strong></li><li><strong>Dave gets dunked in a suit made of 3,400 Alka-Seltzers</strong></li><li><strong>The very first top 10 list</strong></li><li><strong>Cher calls Dave an a–hole</strong></li><li><strong>Madonna won’t stop stop cursing</strong></li><li><strong>Drew Barrymore flashes Dave for his birthday</strong></li><li><strong>Dave gets personal</strong></li><li><strong>Dave gives a heartfelt post-9/11 monologue</strong></li><li><strong>Joaquin Phoenix is bizarre and rambling</strong></li></ul><p>When a Watch What Happens Live caller asked Barrymore if she stayed in contact with Letterman, she was more forthright than usual. Instead of just saying that she isn't close with Letterman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barrymore threw a mild insult at the former talk show host</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Andy-Cohen-hosting-Watch-What-Happens-Live-interviewing-Oprah.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Anderson Cooper's Reaction To Andy Cohen Interviewing Snoop Dogg Was Priceless</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Anderson Cooper couldn't keep it together while Andy Cohen interviewed Snoop Dogg.</span><p>"No, he's a grouch. He was always a grouch."</p><p>After calling Letterman's grouchy personality out, Barrymore went on to talk about how he reacted after her memorable dance. While looking unusually expressive, Barrymore joked about Letterman being nicer to her following their memorable moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/drew-barrymore-burst-into-tears-on-her-show-when-she-was-completely-surprised-by-david-letterman.jpg><p>"I happened to win him over at that moment.

Oh my god, it was spur of the moment, just like, weird, just like hedonistic freedom. I have to say, I wouldn't have respected myself if it was some kind of wh**ey planned thing. It was. I'm not kidding, we ran in the car cause there's always a big crowd of paparazzi outside that Stephen Colbert, David Letterman famous studio. I got in the car with Nan, Jimmy's wife, and I literally went, 'I think something might have gone crazy today. Oh my god, what have I?; I'm glad it happened. It was really fun."</p><h2 id=andy-cohen-thought-drew-barrymore-was-being-too-dramatic>Andy Cohen Thought Drew Barrymore Was Being Too Dramatic</h2><p>After Drew Barrymore explained to Andy Cohen why she couldn't forgive herself for drinking too much on his show, she immediately apologized to him. While it obviously is a good thing for people to apologize if they've done something wrong, Cohen's reaction to Barrymore's apology says a lot.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/even-though-she-s-hosting-a-talk-show-drew-barrymore-says-this-one-actor-could-convince-her-to-do-another-film.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Even Though She's Hosting A Talk Show, Drew Barrymore Says This One Actor Could Convince Her To Do Another Film</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Drew Barrymore has frequently collaborated with this actor and said she wants to do another film with him.</span><p>Instead of accepting Barrymore's apology, Cohen immediately told her she didn't owe him to begin with. More than that, Cohen was frank with Barrymore about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how little impact her appearance on Watch What Happens Live had on him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m used to people being over-served on my show, and so I don’t even really have a totally clear memory of it, but you don’t need to apologize to me for being over-served on my show, that happens.

However, it seems very clear that Cohen was just trying to tell Barrymore that she could let her feelings about that interview go.</p><p>During an episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, the host revealed another time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was embarrassed because of drinking too much</a> . After her guest Tituss Burgess revealed that he and Barrymore went on vacation together once, she remarked she was "too drunk" to remember that happening.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The truth is that, based on all the evidence, the only person who was bothered by Barrymore's conduct was her. After all, everyone knows that people enjoy Watch What Happens Live mostly because stars like Barrymore have much looser lips on that show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibq52nYq%2BivtGypKiqlWKxs8HNpGSappSueqS7x56lZq%2BRqbCpedahmK1lmJa9sbHNrGSloaaaeqq6056pr6GVrHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./marisa-miller-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Marisa Miller Net Worth | TheRichest</a>

lot is happening in her life even though she's no longer being followed by reality TV cameras. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=braunwyn-39-s-relationships>Braunwyn's Relationships</h2><p><a href=#>Braunwyn and Sean's marriage</a> has been hard for some people to understand, but on Braunwyn's final season of RHOC, Braunwyn came out and shared that they were going to stay married but she would be dating women.</p><p>Braunwyn shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Fernanda Rocha were in a relationship</a>, but they broke up after a few months together. According to Us Weekly, Braunwyn said last year, “The first time that we went from friends to maybe a little more — and, like, barely more — was in February. We did not start dating until a month after she filed for divorce [from Tessa Rocha]. We can both date other people. She just got out of a marriage. We’re both in our forties. You know, we really love the time we spend together. She’s amazing. She’s an amazing person, but neither one of us is rushing into labels. … We don’t need to label [the time] we spend together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's interesting to note that Fernanda was on RHOC back in season 6, as a "friend." Fernanda has her own training programs called Fernanda Rocha Fitness and also owns the Art of Fitness gym which is located in Laguna Beach, according to Hollywood Life.</p><p>Braunwyn was also in a relationship with Kris, and according to Page Six, they began their relationship in December 2020 after meeting via a dating app. In April 2021, the two broke up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is The Real Reason There's Fan Backlash About ‘RHOC’?</a></span></p><h2 id=moving-to-nyc>Moving To NYC</h2><p>Moving to a new city is always exciting and also pretty nerve-wracking and stressful.

I'm not just here for the week, I'm making a move. I'm going to be doing a dual situation."</p><p>Braunwyn explained that Sean thought it was a smart move and that he said their children would be okay with it. Braunwyn shared that after a Hawaii vacation, she was able to "find some clarity" and realized that she could be open to living in NYC half the time. This is inspiring to anyone who has wondered if they should change their life and take advantage of chances that have come their way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Braunwyn said, "There's been some pretty amazing opportunities that have come to fruition in New York and it's just the right time." Braunwyn explained her excitement and said that her good friend Amy Schechter works with Million Dollar Listing star Ryan Serhant and she was excited to begin apartment hunting.</p><p>If anyone from RHOC was going to make a big move and change their life, it would definitely be Braunwyn, who always showed herself to be a warm and supportive person on the show. Braunwyn was always kind to her seven children and uses her social media for good, sharing support for the LGBTQ+ community. She's also a mental health advocate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s Why Fans Are Still Bothered By Vicki Gunvalson’s Time On ‘RHOC’</a></span></p><p>It will be interesting to see where Braunwyn Windham Burke's life takes her next, as fans are eager to hear what career opportunities she has in New York City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Braunwyn had a lifestyle blog where she wrote about parenting before joining The Real Housewives of Orange County.

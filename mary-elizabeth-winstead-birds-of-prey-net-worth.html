Sure, people want to act and sing and do all the things they love for a living, but at the end of the day, no one wants to do all of that and be broke. Stars like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwayne Johnson</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a> have all done what they love while making millions of dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mary Elizabeth Winstead may not be a true A-list star yet, but she has been plugging away through the years and has done exceptionally well for herself in the financial department. In fact, some people may be surprised to learn that her net worth exceeds several million dollars at this point.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s net worth and break things down.</p><h2 id=she-is-worth-6-million>She Is Worth $6 Million</h2><p>When taking a look at Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s overall body of work, it is clear that she has remained busy throughout the years and has been able to land roles in lucrative projects. As such, it should not be too surprising to now learn that the actress boasts a net worth of around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 million</a>.</p><p>When looking at the grand scheme of things in terms of popular actors and their net worth, $6 million may not seem like a whole lot of money, but there is a lot more than meets the eye here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her recent performance in the film Birds of Prey, Mary Elizabeth Winston cemented herself as a performer who can thrive in large projects, meaning that studios are going to want to work with her moving forward. Because of this, we could very well see the performer continue to land large roles and larger paydays, eventually taking her bank account to an entirely new level.</p><p>According to IMDb,&nbsp;Winstead will be starring in her very own film, Kate, coming out on Netflix in 2021. It seems like more and more stars are willing to work with the streaming platform given the immediate audience that they can reach, and if things go well here, then we could see Winsted take another step in becoming an even bigger star.</p><p>Building up to this recent breakthrough, Winstead had put together a solid body of work, and her time on the big screen has been a huge boost to her net worth throughout the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Fans Think Margot Robbie’s Talent Is Overshadowed By Her Looks</a></span></p><h2 id=movies-have-boosted-her-bank-account>Movies Have Boosted Her Bank Account</h2><p>As we have mentioned already Mary Elizabeth Winstead isn’t an A-list of talent yet, but a quick look through her body of work will reveal that she has taken part in a number of successful projects throughout the years. Because of this, she has been able to make a solid amount of money.</p><p>According to IMDb, Winstead was able to land roles in successful films like The Ring 2 and Sky High&nbsp;much earlier on in her career. No, these roles were not something that were going to put her in awards contention, but they were a nice way to get the ball rolling on what she would be able to accomplish down the line.</p><p>Interestingly, we have seen the actor take part in darker films in the past. Earlier on in her career, Winsted had been featured in films like Final Destination 3 and Black Christmas, meaning that she has done pretty well for herself in the darker side of things. Let’s not forget that Winstead also landed a role in the Quentin Tarantino film&nbsp;Death Proof, which was an homage to exploitation slasher films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As great as it is that Winstead&nbsp;has been able to thrive in darker films, she has also been able to land roles in other projects that have allowed her to show her range. Some of her other notable projects include Scott Pilgrim vs.&nbsp;the World,&nbsp;Live Free or Die Hard, 10 Cloverfield Lane,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gemini Man.</p><p>Turns out, Winstead can thrive on the small screen, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Reason One ‘Suicide Squad’ Scene Resulted In The Most Difficult Moment In Margot Robbie’s Life</a></span></p><h2 id=television-has-also-helped>Television Has Also Helped</h2><p>Before making the transition into film and doing well for herself there, Mary Elizabeth Winstead was actually a featured performer on the soap opera Passions,&nbsp;and she began her time on the show back in the late 90s. In the following years, she would get the chance to appear in other popular shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After making the transition to movies, Winstead would take a lengthy break from the small screen, but once she got back to business, she was able to start making moves. Since 2016, Winstead’s television body of work has included roles on BrainDead and Mercy Street.</p><p>In the last few years, the argument can be made that the biggest television project that Winstead took part in was a main&nbsp;role in the series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fargo</a> during its&nbsp;third season. While she could land larger television roles in the future, it seems as though working on movies has been best for her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Movie Costumes Celebrities Kept After Filming</a></span></p><p>Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s $6 million net worth looks as though it has a good chance of going up in no time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Behind The Creation Of Harley Quinn</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqpYrKttdmamZ6smGLEqrrSrZyanF2XtrOw0mamn2Wgp7K6ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./east-greenbush-central-school-district-under-lockdown-amidst-voicemail-security-threat.html>&#171;&nbsp;East Greenbush Central School District under lockdown amidst voicemail security threat</a>
